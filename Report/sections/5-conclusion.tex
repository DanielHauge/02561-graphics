\section{Conclusion}
- Sensors from a phone can be used to capture and virtualize movements.
- The resulting solution is not super usefull but demonstrates potential for other applications.
- Unfortunately the solutions does not support displacement, which would have been cool.

% Sensors from modern smartphones can be used to capture and virtualize movements.
