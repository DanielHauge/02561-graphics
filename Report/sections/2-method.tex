\section{Method}
There are challenges the problem at hand etc.

\subsection{Capture physical movements}
Sensors. Magnetic \& Accelerometors Light? etc.
Choosing Magnetic and accelerometors, as it can be self contained etc.

The phone has these sensors and can be used as a sort of controller for capturing movements.

\subsection{Data transfer}
Wireless transfer to allow for 100\% freedom in movements. Bluetooth, wifi.
Requirement: 100\% freedom in movements. The object should only be under constraints as in the real world.
A phone is still a good candidat for this requirement, as it is wireless. 

Wifi is used picked, as it is adequately fast and reliable.

\subsection{Display}
Using a triangle mesh to instantiate vertex. 
We can use affine transformation with a rotation and translation matrix to move the object in virtual space.
