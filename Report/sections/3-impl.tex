\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Capturing physical movements}
\subsubsection{Orientation}
- Javascript AbsoluteOrientationSensor etc.

\subsubsection{Displacement}
- Javascript LinearAccelerationSensor
% Attempt at additional 3 degrees of freedom. Back, forward, left, right, up and down.
% Utilizing physics equations
% My accelerometer was not accurate enough. (Did not make it in time) 


\subsection{Data transfer}
- Power of websockets

\subsection{Display}
- Implementation of stuff.
% Capturing movements:
% - Capture physical movements : Phone sensors can be utilized
% - Data transfer : Solved by websockets
% - Displaying object : Qaurtinions into matrices, which are then multiplied + triangle mesh.
